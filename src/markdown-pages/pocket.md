description: 'Pocket is the product of my first-ever hackathon, the Accenture
  Melbourne Hackathon in 2019.
  The app is intended to build upon and integrate with existing bank
  features to afford users’ more control over their money. The basic
  premise is that users can create virtual accounts - known as ‘pockets’ -
  to which they can apply spend categories, and spending limits.
  See below for a video demonstration of the app. You can also check it
  out on expo '
