description: 'The idea for Nourish came from a final university project. We
  wanted to help equip people with more knowledge around the
  sustainability of the products they purchase. By utilising a react-native barcode scanning library and building our
  own database, we were able to reveal sustainability information about a
  product, simply by scanning product barcodes.'
